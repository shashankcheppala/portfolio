  description: `
    I'm a graduate student in Data Analytics at the University of Illinois Springfield,
    focused on NLP, computer vision, and end-to-end ML systems. I enjoy building
    clean pipelines, explainable models, and intuitive user-facing tools.

    My academic and project work includes Fake News Detection using LLMs & Deep Learning,
    and Emotion-Aware Hybrid Deepfake Detection. Alongside ML, I bring strong skills in
    Python, SQL, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, Spark, Tableau, and Power BI.

    Recognized for problem-solving, technical writing, and leadership, I'm eager to apply
    my skills to real-world data challenges and collaborative innovation.
